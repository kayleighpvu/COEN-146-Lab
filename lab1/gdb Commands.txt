Steps to use gdb debugger when running C code:

1) Compile code using -g option.
	Example: gcc -g my_program.c

2) Launch the gdb compiler on the executable created from the first step
	Example: gdb ./my_exe

3) Set up break point in code as follows:
	break line_number

4) Run your program as follows:
	run [command_line_arguments_if_any]

5) Print value of variables as follows:
	print variable_name

6) Execute the next line in your code using one of the following methods:
	i) c or continue: Debugger will continue executing until the next break point.
	ii) n or next: Debugger will execute the next line as single instruction.
	iii) s or step: Same as next, but does not treats function as a single instruction, instead goes into the
           function and executes it line by line.
